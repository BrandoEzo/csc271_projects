# Peer Review
## Content & Audience
- My peers clearly understood the purpose of my site! No content or messaging changes required.
# Design & User Experience
- Easy to navigate, engaging colors, simple to look at but eye catching, great pictures.
- They found my design effective in communicating my product and keeping users engaged.  
# Functionality & Performance
- No issues in terms of features and interactivity! 
- A few performance issues uncovered via Lighthouse, mainly due to bad loading of pictures and a few others, mostly on mobile.
- No visual issues with mobile or smaller window sizes.
# Accessibility & Usability
- This area easily had the most issues, as there were several color contrast issues. There were also a few images missing alt text. 
- These fixes are pretty simple, I just need to ensure all images have alt text and increase the color contrast to ensure all text is more readable.
- The site is fully navigatable with only a keyboard at least!
# Action Plan
- Simple and easy to use/navigate, engaging colors, fun images, welcoming website for those who share an interest in gaming to gather together
- My main focus will be improving accessability, ensuring I update the colors on the CSS style sheet to increase contrast and make the text more clear, as well as ensure all images have proper alt text.
- I will also try to fix the performance issues brought up by the Lighthouse audit, to hopefully make the site run better on mobile and desktop.
