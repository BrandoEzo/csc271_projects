    <p>
        This is a traditional polish dish and a staple in my household. It's a simple recepie, with pierogies, which are 
        traditional polish dumplings, sauteed in a frying pan with onions, garlic, salt and pepper for flavor. The pierogies can be homeade
        with any additional fillings, alongside the standard potato and cheese, or simply storebought for convinience.
        I learned the recipe from my dad.
